The Dutch seemed to have complete disregard for their own safety, as was evident by their exclusive use of bicycles in a war fought entirely at sea. One man remarked that the Dutch must've been drunk, and it is from this incident the term \"Dutch Courage\" originates. Taking a drink before a stressful situation in order to stiffen one's resolve has long been referred to by this term, but <span class=\"italic\">The Real Dutch Courage</span> seeks to obliterate this myth and reveal the true source of the Dutch sailors' bravery - the humble wasp. Each Dutchman took to battle a tiny wooden windmill filled with wasps affixed to their inner thigh as a method of encouragement, and the story of how this tradition came to pass truly is a tale for the ages.","effect":"Doubles nerve regeneration for 31 days.","requirement":"","type":"Book","weapon_type":null,"buy_price":0,"sell_price":0,"market_value":0,"circulation":9765,"image":"https://www.torn.com/images/items/775/large.png"},"776":{"name":"Book : Because I'm Happy - The Pharrell Story","description":"The popular musician and producer Pharrell Williams has long suffered from a debilitating mental condition which causes him to smile at all times, regardless as to whether the situation calls for it. The \"Happy\" hitmaker is often seen grinning at road traffic accidents, laughing at unfortunate medical diagnoses, and seeming positively ecstatic when informed of the death of a close family friend. This condition was caused by a blow to the head suffered when a 6 year old Pharrell was hit by an ice cream truck whilst walking his dog. However, when the young RnB sensation awoke to find his canine companion had passed away after gorging itself on chocolate snow-cones spilled during the accident, he found the news so funny he became unable to shed tears ever again.
